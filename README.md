# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide is designed to help incoming UCI Coding Bootcamp students understand the core functions of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. It serves as a quick reference guide for beginners.
Through creating this guide, I’ve gained foundational knowledge of these coding languages. My curiosity and desire to explore more complex topics, such as programming languages, is what inspired me to develop this resource.
